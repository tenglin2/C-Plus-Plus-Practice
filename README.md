## C++ Projects

### Overview
These are a collection of projects that I completed for my C++ class, CS122, in my first year at Penn State University.

### What I Learn
This semester long course was a great introduction to how powerful C++ can actually be. The instructor, Professor Reggio, was incredibly clear and helpful throughout the whole course. We covered a variety of topics which I will list.

- Basic Class Structuring, Constructors, Functions, etc.
- Header and Implementation Files
- Pointers
- Linked Lists, Nodes, Head & Tails
- Stack and Queue Structures
- Recursive Functions
- Trees, Binary Trees, Tree Traversal, Balanced Trees, Expression Trees
- Heap vs. Stack, Memory Allocation
- Sorting Run Time Analysis, Bucket Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort
- Some Other Stuff I'm Forgetting

Great course that I really enjoyed.
